# DesignPatterns
This repository contains code to explain all types of design patterns
1. Strategy pattern:
Defines a family of algorithms encapsulating each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

Use case:
Duck have fly and quack behaviour and a MallardDuck is a type of Duck but now--
A new Duck named ModelDuck has been introduced which quack & doesn't fly behaviour and
a new Behaviour FlyRocketPowered behaviour has been introduced by client which we want to provide at Run time to ModelDuck
in Main class.

2. Adapter Pattern:
The Adapter Pattern Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Use case:
you want to use an existing class, and its interface doesn't match the one you need.
you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, classes tht dont necessarily have compatible
interfaces.
you want to use several existing subclasses, but its impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing everyone.
An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.
